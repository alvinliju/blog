**Ultrasonic Cross-Device Tracking**

**Abstract**

Ultrasonic cross-device tracking (uXDT) is a novel and clandestine method used by advertisers, corporations, and researchers to track users across multiple devices. By utilizing high-frequency sound waves inaudible to humans, data can be transmitted between devices, even if some are disconnected from the internet. This paper examines the current state of ultrasonic tracking technology, its implications for user privacy, methods of exploitation, and potential defenses. Drawing on academic research and recent developments in the field, we explore the effectiveness of current countermeasures and propose ways to enhance user control over their data.

###  **Introduction**

In the digital age, the ability to track users across multiple devices is highly desirable for advertisers and corporations seeking to build comprehensive profiles of individual users. Ultrasonic cross-device tracking (uXDT) allows this by using high-frequency sound waves, known as ultrasonic beacons, to communicate between nearby devices. Unlike traditional tracking methods that rely on cookies or IP addresses, uXDT can function without user consent, making it a potent tool for surveillance and advertising.

This paper explores the mechanisms behind uXDT, its development over the years, and its impact on user privacy. We will also discuss how advertisers and other actors exploit the technology to enhance cross-device tracking accuracy. Finally, we will examine the defenses available to users, including software and hardware-based solutions, and the need for further development in privacy-enhancing technologies.

### **Ultrasonic Tracking Technology**

Ultrasonic tracking technology relies on high-frequency sound waves, typically in the range of 18 to 24 kHz, that can transmit data between devices equipped with microphones, speakers, or sensors. These frequencies are inaudible to the human ear but can be detected by smartphones, tablets, smart speakers, and other Internet of Things (IoT) devices. The technology is particularly effective in densely populated areas, where multiple devices can communicate and transfer data using ultrasonic signals.

One of the key mechanisms driving uXDT is audio beacons, which are short ultrasonic signals embedded within advertisements, TV shows, radio broadcasts, or even physical spaces like billboards. When a device equipped with a microphone detects these beacons, it transmits identifying information, such as location or device type, back to a central server for analysis. This allows advertisers to track users across multiple environments and establish a more complete profile of their behavior.

In 2017, researchers from the University of Xizhian in China demonstrated how these ultrasonic signals could be used to issue commands to smart devices via virtual assistants like Siri or Alexa. This method, known as the **Dolphin Attack**, allowed them to remotely open websites and control devices by sending ultrasonic commands to the assistants without user knowledge .

###  **Exploitation Methods**

Ultrasonic tracking technology can be exploited in several ways, allowing adversaries to track users or issue commands to their devices without permission. Below are some of the key techniques used in uXDT:

####  **Dolphin Attack**

As mentioned above, the Dolphin Attack allows for ultrasonic commands to be sent to virtual assistants on smart devices. By emitting ultrasonic frequencies in the range of 20 kHz, adversaries can take control of virtual assistants and instruct them to perform actions such as visiting malicious websites or opening apps, even when the device is locked .

#### **Gyroscope Exploitation**

In 2018, researchers from Yale University and the Technical University of Darmstadt in Germany found that gyroscope sensors could be exploited for ultrasonic cross-device tracking. Gyroscopes, commonly used in smartphones to measure device orientation, have a resonance frequency between 19 to 29 kHz. This makes them vulnerable to ultrasonic signals and allows for data transmission between devices without needing access to a microphone. Gyroscope-based uXDT is particularly concerning as gyroscope sensors usually do not require user permission to operate  .

####  **Headphone-to-Headphone Transmission**

Another recent development in uXDT is the ability to transmit data between passive speakers or headphones that lack microphone functionality. In 2023, researchers demonstrated that by reverse-engineering passive speakers, they could transmit ultrasonic signals over short distances. This capability highlights the growing sophistication of uXDT and suggests that even devices without microphones may not be safe from exploitation .

###  **Privacy Implications**

The privacy implications of uXDT are profound. Unlike traditional tracking mechanisms that rely on cookies or browser fingerprinting, ultrasonic tracking operates outside the bounds of user control. Even if users restrict microphone access on their devices or go offline, ultrasonic beacons can still communicate between nearby devices, creating an ecosystem where users' behavior and location are constantly monitored.

**Cross-device tracking** is particularly concerning, as advertisers can now link user activity across devices, including smartphones, laptops, and even TVs. This technology allows for the creation of highly detailed profiles, which can then be used to serve targeted ads or sell user data to third parties.

###  **Defenses Against Ultrasonic Tracking**

While the threat posed by uXDT is significant, there are some ways users can defend themselves. The most basic method involves restricting microphone permissions on smartphones and other devices. However, this only mitigates part of the threat, as gyroscopes and speakers can also be exploited for uXDT.

#### **Hardware-Based Defenses**

The most effective defense against ultrasonic tracking would be to use **hardware switches** that physically disconnect the microphone or sensor when not in use. This prevents any data from being transmitted, even if the device's software is compromised. However, such switches are currently only available on a few specialized devices, and they are not yet mainstream .

#### **Software-Based Defenses**

Another method of defense is to use operating systems that allow users to control sensor access. For example, **GrapheneOS**, a privacy-focused Android OS, includes a permission toggle for sensor access, allowing users to disable gyroscope-based tracking. Open-source apps that do not engage in tracking are also a safer alternative to mainstream apps that may contain embedded uXDT technology .

### **Conclusion**

Ultrasonic cross-device tracking represents a hidden but significant threat to user privacy in the digital age. As technology advances, the ability to track users across devices using high-frequency sound waves is becoming increasingly common. The Dolphin Attack, gyroscope exploitation, and headphone-to-headphone transmission are just some of the methods used to leverage this technology for tracking purposes. Defending against uXDT requires a combination of hardware and software-based approaches, and greater transparency is needed from companies developing and embedding these technologies into their products.

Governments and organizations must also prioritize user privacy and ensure that ultrasonic tracking is adequately regulated. For now, the best defense lies in user awareness and a shift toward privacy-focused operating systems and applications.
