## Introduction To Cryptography

## So lets start with a question, What is Cryptography?

Cryptography is **THE** art of securing information by transforming it into a form that is unreadable unless you know how to decode. Its like talking cussing your Italian friend in Sanskrit unless he has a Sanskrit-Italian  dictionary you are safe.

Think of cryptography as a secret language only you and your friend know so that you could talk so that your conversation stays private. This secret language is created using mathematical formulas and rules, making it very hard for others to figure out what you're saying unless they have the special key to translate it back. Cryptography is used everywhere, from sending emails to buying things online, to keep our personal information safe and our messages private 

## Fundamentals

 **Encryption**: Introduces the notion of secure encryption, from weak pen-and-paper ciphers to strong randomised encryption.

**Randomness**:A Pseudo Random Generator (PRG) produces sequences of numbers that appear random but are generated by deterministic algorithms. These sequences are not truly random since they depend on an initial value, known as the seed. PRGs are crucial for simulations, games, and cryptography, especially where reproducibility and speed are important.

**Cryptographic Security**: Comparing provable security with probable security.

### Terms to keep in mind:

**Plain Text**: Plain text is the text/data before encryption.

**Cipher Text**:The text/data after encryption is called cipher text, you'll see this word in any cryptographic blog or book. 

## Encryption
- Encryption is the principal application of cryptography 
- Makes data incomprehensible(idk if its a proper word) in order to ensure Confidentiality
- The algorithm we use to encrypt is called **CIPHER** and the secret term/number we use to make the encryption completely random is called a  **KEY**

In simple terms, imagine you want to send a secret letter to a friend so that only they can read it. To do this, you use a special rule or method, which we call a **cipher**, to scramble the letter. This scrambled version is what gets sent through the mail. Now, to make sure that nobody else can unscramble your letter, you use a special secret word or number, known as a **key**. This key helps apply the cipher in such a unique way that only someone who knows the key can reverse the scrambling and read your original letter.

## Hashing 

**why hashing?**
**how hashing?**
**WHAT IS HASHING?**

Hashing is nothing but a way to ensure the integrity of a message, in Feynman terms if you wanna make sure that the message your friend send was actually send by him we use hashing.
Hashing is one of the fundamental concept of cryptography which transforms a data into fixed size string called **Hash**, The function we use to do the hash is called the **Hash function**.

Regardless the size of the data, The hash algorithm produces a fixed size string called the hash value or digest for this we use algorithms like MD5(deprecated), SHA-256 etc..The hashing process consists of splitting the data into blocks of fixed sizes, processing each block in sequence and applying various operations like column shifting, row shifting, XOR's etc(AES) 
## Encoding 
Encoding is not done for security its basically transforming data from one form to another not with an intention to conceal the data.encoding is primarily used to maintain the usability of data across multiple platforms.

Examples of encoding techniques include ASCII, UNICODE, URL encoding, and Base64. These methods are commonly used for tasks such as ensuring special characters display correctly on web pages or preparing binary data for transmission over media designed to handle text.

### Encryption
Now lets go back to the fundamental concept of cryptography which is Encryption,
lets see various encryption methods and what are the applications of encryption

Creating a comprehensive write-up about cryptography from scratch is a great way to solidify your understanding of encryption and its various aspects. Let's break down each of these topics in detail:

## Basics of Cryptography

Cryptography is the science of securing information by transforming it into a secure format. It ensures the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of data. The two primary goals of cryptography are to protect data from unauthorized access and to verify the authenticity of a message.

### Key Terms

- **Plaintext:** The original message or data that needs to be secured.
- **Ciphertext:** The encrypted message that is not understandable without the proper decryption key.
- **Encryption:** The process of converting plaintext into ciphertext.
- **Decryption:** The process of converting ciphertext back to plaintext using a decryption key.
- **Key:** A piece of information used in the encryption and decryption process.

## Classical Ciphers

Classical ciphers are the simplest and oldest encryption techniques. They were used in historical contexts but laid the foundation for modern cryptography.

### Types of Classical Ciphers

1. **Caesar Cipher:** A substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 3, A becomes D, B becomes E, etc.

2. **Substitution Cipher:** A method where each letter in the plaintext is replaced with another letter. This cipher uses a fixed system for the substitution.

3. **Transposition Cipher:** Instead of substituting characters, transposition ciphers rearrange the letters of the plaintext according to a fixed system, which might involve reversing text, rearranging letters based on a key, etc.

### Vigenère Cipher

The Vigenère cipher is a more complex form of a substitution cipher that uses a keyword to shift letters by different amounts based on their position in the keyword.

- **How It Works:**
  - Write the keyword repeatedly above the plaintext.
  - Shift each letter of the plaintext by the corresponding letter of the keyword.

For example, if the keyword is `KEY`, the plaintext `HELLO` would be encrypted as follows:

| Plaintext  | H   | E   | L   | L   | O   |
| ---------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Keyword    | K   | E   | Y   | K   | E   |
| Shift      | 10  | 4   | 24  | 10  | 4   |
| Ciphertext | R   | I   | J   | V   | S   |

This creates a much more secure encryption compared to simple substitution ciphers due to its polyalphabetic nature.

### How Ciphers Work: Permutation and Modes of Operation

#### Permutation

Permutation involves rearranging elements according to a specific sequence. In cryptography, permutation is often used to mix up the bits of data to enhance security.

- **Block Ciphers:** Use permutation and substitution to transform fixed-size blocks of plaintext into ciphertext.

#### Modes of Operation

Modes of operation define how block ciphers are applied to plaintext data that might be larger than a block.

1. **Electronic Codebook (ECB):** Encrypts each block independently. Identical plaintext blocks result in identical ciphertext blocks, making it insecure for large data sets with repeating patterns.

2. **Cipher Block Chaining (CBC):** Each plaintext block is XORed with the previous ciphertext block before encryption, adding a dependency between blocks and providing better security than ECB.

3. **Cipher Feedback (CFB):** Converts block ciphers into a self-synchronizing stream cipher by feeding back ciphertext as input to the cipher.

4. **Output Feedback (OFB):** Similar to CFB, but outputs a keystream independent of the plaintext, providing error propagation prevention.

5. **Counter (CTR):** Uses a counter to generate a keystream that is XORed with the plaintext. It allows for parallel processing and is highly efficient.

### One-Time Pad

The One-Time Pad (OTP) is a theoretically unbreakable encryption technique when used correctly. It involves using a random key that is as long as the message itself.

- **How It Works:**
  - XOR each bit of the plaintext with the corresponding bit of a random key of the same length.
  - The key must remain secret, be truly random, and used only once.

While secure, the one-time pad is impractical for most applications due to the difficulty of generating, sharing, and managing truly random keys.

### Probability in Cryptography

Probability theory plays a crucial role in analyzing the strength of cryptographic algorithms, determining the likelihood of breaking encryption, and designing secure systems.

- **Entropy:** A measure of uncertainty or randomness. High entropy in keys ensures they are difficult to guess.
- **Collision Probability:** The chance that two different inputs produce the same hash or ciphertext, which is a concern in hash functions and block ciphers.

### Kerckhoffs's Principle

Kerckhoffs's Principle states that a cryptographic system should remain secure even if everything about the system, except the key, is known to an adversary. This principle emphasizes the importance of keeping encryption keys secret rather than the algorithms themselves.

### Security Goals

#### Indistinguishability

A cipher achieves indistinguishability if an attacker cannot determine any difference between two ciphertexts, even with unlimited computational power.

#### Non-Malleability

Non-malleability ensures that ciphertexts cannot be altered without detection. An attacker should not be able to manipulate a ciphertext to produce a related plaintext.

### Symmetric Encryption

Symmetric encryption uses a single key for both encryption and decryption. It is fast and efficient but requires secure key distribution.

#### Common Symmetric Algorithms

- **Data Encryption Standard (DES):** A block cipher that uses a 56-bit key. It is now considered insecure due to its short key length.

- **Advanced Encryption Standard (AES):** A widely used block cipher with key lengths of 128, 192, or 256 bits. AES is secure and used in various applications, including SSL/TLS.

### Asymmetric Encryption

Asymmetric encryption uses a pair of keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. It enables secure key exchange and digital signatures.

#### Common Asymmetric Algorithms

- **RSA:** Based on the difficulty of factoring large integers, RSA is widely used for secure data transmission.

- **Diffie-Hellman (DH):** A key exchange protocol that allows secure key exchange over an insecure channel.

### Types of Encryption

#### Authenticated Encryption

Authenticated encryption provides both confidentiality and integrity of data. It combines encryption with message authentication codes (MACs) to ensure data is not tampered with.

#### Format-Preserving Encryption

Format-preserving encryption (FPE) maintains the format of the plaintext while encrypting it. For example, encrypting a credit card number while keeping the format of a valid credit card number.

#### Fully Homomorphic Encryption

Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) allows computations to be performed on ciphertexts without decrypting them. It enables secure processing of data in encrypted form.

#### Searchable Encryption

Searchable encryption allows searching on encrypted data without decrypting it. It is useful for secure search in encrypted databases.

#### Tweakable Encryption

Tweakable encryption uses a secondary input called a "tweak" to modify the encryption process. It provides additional flexibility and security in certain applications.

### Block Ciphers

Block ciphers encrypt fixed-size blocks of data and use permutation and substitution techniques. They require padding for data that doesn't fit the block size.

- **Common Block Ciphers:**
  - AES
  - DES

### Stream Ciphers

Stream ciphers encrypt data one bit or byte at a time, generating a keystream from a pseudorandom generator.

- **Examples:**
  - RC4: A widely used stream cipher, but now considered insecure due to vulnerabilities.
  - ChaCha20: A secure and efficient stream cipher used in modern applications.

### AES and DES

#### Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)

AES is a symmetric block cipher standardized by NIST. It supports key lengths of 128, 192, and 256 bits and uses a combination of substitution, permutation, and mixing operations.

#### Data Encryption Standard (DES)

DES is an older symmetric block cipher with a 56-bit key. Due to its vulnerability to brute-force attacks, it has been replaced by more secure algorithms like AES.

### RSA and Diffie-Hellman

#### RSA

RSA is an asymmetric encryption algorithm based on the mathematical properties of large prime numbers. It is widely used for secure data transmission, digital signatures, and key exchange.

- **How It Works:**
  - Key Generation: Select two large prime numbers and compute their product as the modulus.
  - Encryption: Use the public key to encrypt data.
  - Decryption: Use the private key to decrypt data.

#### Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange (DHE)

Diffie-Hellman is a key exchange protocol that allows two parties to securely share a secret key over an insecure channel.

- **How It Works:**
  - Each party selects a private key and computes a public value.
  - The shared secret is derived from the exchanged public values and the private key.

## Conclusion

Cryptography is a fundamental aspect of modern security, providing the tools necessary to protect data and communications from unauthorized access and tampering. By understanding the various encryption methods, principles, and security goals, you can better appreciate the complexity and importance of cryptography in today's digital world.
